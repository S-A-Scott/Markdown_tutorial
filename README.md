# Markdown Basics


## What is Markdown

[Markdown](daringfireball.net/project/markdown) is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

## Github Flavored Markdown

GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of
useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com

# Lesson1 Emphasis and Headers

We'll start by learning two basic elements in Markdown: **_Emphasis_** and headers.

## Emphasis

There are two ways to emphasis the text: _italics_ and **bold**.

### Italics

To make a phrase _italic_ in Markdown, you can surround words with an undersocre(_).
For example, input:

> This text will be _italic_.

```
This text will be _italic_.
```

will output:  
This text will be _italic_.

### Bold

## Headers
